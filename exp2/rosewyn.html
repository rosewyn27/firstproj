<p>Photography is the art of capturing light with a camera, usually via a digital sensor or film, to create an image. With the right camera equipment, you can even<br> photograph wavelengths of light invisible to the human eye, including UV, infrared, and radio.
The first permanent photograph was captured in 1826 (some sources say 1827) by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in France.

<h1><b><font face="Baskerville Old Face">What Camera Do You Need for Photography?</font></b></h1>
<p>
Many people today believe that their phone is good enough for most photography, and they have no need to buy a separate camera. And you know what? They’re not wrong.<br> For most people out there, a dedicated camera is overkill.

Phones are better than dedicated cameras for most people’s needs. They’re quicker and easier to use, not to mention their seamless integration with social media. <br>It only makes sense to get a dedicated camera if your phone isn’t good enough for the photos you want (like photographing sports or low-light environments) <br>or if you’re specifically interested in photography as a hobby.

That advice may sound crazy coming from a photographer, but it’s true. If you have any camera at all, especially a cell phone camera, you have what you need <br> in order to take great photos. And if you have a more advanced camera, like a DSLR or mirrorless camera, what more is there to say? <br>This is the guide for you – it’s time to learn photography.

<h1><font face="Baskerville Old Face">The Three Fundamental Camera Settings You Should Know </font></h1>
<pre><b>Shutter speed</b>: The amount of time your camera sensor is exposed to the world while taking a picture. 
<b>Aperture</b>: Represents a “pupil” in your lens that can open and close to let in different amounts of light. 
<b>ISO</b>: Technically a bit more complex, but similar to the sensitivity of film for taking pictures in different lighting conditions. <br>

<h1><b>What is Composition?</b></h1>
<p>Composition is how the elements of a photo are arranged. A composition can me made up of many different elements, or only a few. It's how the artist puts those things within a frame that help a photograph become more or less interesting to the viewer.
A good photograph will take many different parts and combine them into an aesthetically pleasing whole. Composition is how an artist tells a story within the confines of a single frame
</p>

<h1><b>Why is Composition Important in Photography?</b></h1>
<p>
How many times have you seen a photograph that seemed to be taken in an amazing location with an incredible subject, but the image didn't do much for you? The problem very well might be that the composition was off.
</p>
<p>
Composition is everything when it comes to a photograph. Oftentimes, the technical side of an image is pretty easy to learn, so the one thing that separates a great image from one that is less interesting is the composition.  
</p>
<p>
Everyone has a camera these days, so how you are able to visually capture something that is also being photographed by the masses right alongside you will help to distinguish your work from other photographers. Hopefully, this will gain you the success or business you seek.

<h1><b>Composition Techniques That Will Improve Your Photos</b></h1>
<ol type="1">
<h3><b><li> Rule of Thirds</li></b></h3>

The rule of thirds is the most talked up of the rules of composition and is one of the easiest ways to teach photography composition for beginners.<br> It's not the end-all-be-all rule, but it's a fabulous starting place.

To practice this rule, divide the frame of your photograph with two equally spaced vertical lines and two similar horizontal lines.<br> These lines and the four points at which they meet create areas on your frame for placing subjects and essential elements.

Probably the most important takeaway from the rule of thirds is that subjects generally do not belong centered in the frame. By placing them carefully using the rule <br> of thirds, you can control the final image and the journey your viewer takes through the frame.<br>

<h3><b><li> Leading Lines</li></b></h3>
Once you start looking for them, lead lines are everywhere. A road, a rough footpath, a shoreline, a distant mountain range, the vertical trunks of trees in a forest, <br>  or even the arms and legs of a model can all be used in the composition of a photograph. At first, straight lead lines are the easiest to identify and follow. <br> But as soon as you realize that a lead line simply leads your eyes, it becomes clear that even curved lines can get the job done. Leading lines are <br> photography composition basics, which needs to be mastered.<br>
<img src="leading-lines-composition-1.jpg" width="400" height="200" align="center">

<br>The idea of lead lines is that the photographer arranges these elements in the photograph to lead the viewers' eyes to the subject. Once you know what to look for, <br> you'll see lead lines everywhere.<br>

<h3><b><li> Capturing Symmetry</li></b></h3>
Symmetrical scenes can make beautiful photographs. Think of reflection pools near monuments or calm mountain lakes reflecting fall colors. Likewise,<br> architecture is full of symmetry. In some ways, human brains are programmed to respond to symmetry, so it always makes a captivating and exciting capture.<br><br>
<img src="Symmentry1.jpg" width="200" height="500" align="center">
<img src="symmetry-composition.jpg" width="500" height="200" align="right"><br>

Symmetrical photos seldom follow the rule of thirds or the golden ratio. More often than not, the horizon bisects the frame equally, and the subject is centered. <br> Sometimes it's okay to break the rules, but only if you realize why it works.

<h3><b><li> Frame Within the Frame</li></b></h3>
Including a ‘frame withing the frame’ is another effective way of portraying depth in a scene. Look for elements such as windows, arches or overhanging branches to frame the scene with. The ‘frame’ does not necessarily  have to surround the entire scene to be effective.They can isolate your subject, drawing the eye directly to it, they can hide unwanted items behind it, give an image depth and help create context. Using a ‘frame within a frame’ presents a great opportunity to use your surroundings to be creative in your compositions.<br><br>

<h3><b><li>Foreground Interest and Depth</li></b></h3>
A foreground is the part of a scene that is nearest to and in front of the photographer. In a sense, it is the stuff that is right at your feet. Not any foreground will do!Having something of visual interest that is closer than your main subject adds depth and compositional power, even if that something is quite far away from you. As long as you include something that is between you and your subject, it will achieve your goal of creating depth and a dynamic visual relationship between nearer and farther elements. Foregrounds aren’t just for wide-angle lenses either; you can use foregrounds with longer lenses too. Having something of visual interest that is closer than your main subject adds depth and compositional power, even if that something is quite far away from you. <br><br>

<h3><b><li>Viewpoint </li></b></h3>
Most photos are taken from eye level. Changing your position, and therefore your viewpoint, can dramatically change the image. Getting down low to photograph your subject, or positioning yourself at greater height than your subject will create a very different image.
Different viewpoints will certainly add more drama to your photography composition than the expected standing height viewpoint.Your viewpoint in photography is your perspective on the world you’re photographing. Your choice of photography viewpoint when composing an image forms part of the story you’re telling in your photograph.<br>

<h3><b><li> Rule of Space </li></b></h3>
The rule of space relates to the direction the subject(s) in your photo are facing or moving towards.The rule of space suggests that the subject should be looking or facing into the frame rather than out of it. The Rule of Space adds a Feeling of Motion or Action.As humans, we tend to look at the eyes of the subject first and then in the direction the eyes are pointed.  As a photographer, this can be to our advantage. It gives us the ability to lead the eyes of the viewer around the image in a very specific way.<br>
